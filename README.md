This is the recipe of Cheese Pizza in which you gonna make a delicious cheese pizza cake by adding cheese and some more little things like toppings

INGREDIENTS
Yeast: Instant yeast makes the job quicker. You need 1 standard packet.
Water: Use warm water to cut down on rise time, about 105ºF – 115ºF. Anything over 130ºF is too hot.
Flour: Use unbleached all-purpose white flour in the pizza crust. Bleaching the flour strips away some of the protein, which will affect how much water the flour absorbs.
Oil: Extra virgin olive oil adds wonderful flavor to the dough. Don’t forget to brush the dough with olive oil before adding the toppings, which prevents the crust from tasting soggy.
Salt: Adds flavor.
Sugar: A little sugar increases the yeast’s activity and tenderizes the pizza dough.
Cornmeal: Use cornmeal to dust the pizza pan; it gives the pizza crust a little extra flavor and crisp.

RECIPE
Prepare the pizza dough through step 6, including preheating the oven to 475°F (246°C) as described in step 4.
Top the dough with the pizza sauce, then the sliced mozzarella, then the shredded mozzarella, grated Parmesan, then sprinkle with basil.
Bake for 12-15 minutes. For the last minute, I move the oven rack to the top rack to really brown the edges. That’s optional.
Slice hot pizza and serve immediately. Cover leftover pizza tightly and store in the refrigerator. Reheat as you prefer. Baked pizza slices can be frozen up to 3 months.
